# Implementation and Vizualization of Merkle tree in python.
# Run in Terminal, before Executing 
## pip install graphviz
## Requires a minimum of 1 inputs, beyond that feel free to try and break it. I haven't checked how many leaf nodes it can handle max but its built to ensure we always have enough leaf nodes to build the tree, copies the last element in the list indefinitley to fill.
basic merkle tree
vizualization of trees built.
below are links to soucres I found helpful when researching merkle trees and implementations
my sources persay. there were some portion that were more difficult to figure out and had to refer to the geeksforgeeks binary tree iplementation for the how setup the equivelent of pointer in python as I had never created a tree of nodes within python.

Some of my favorite parts of this were succesfully creating a merkle tree, While I did not get around to a merkle proof, I really enjoyed implementing a graphics vizualiser was a lot of fun and a good learning experiance as I hadn't used one since college and I think it was a much simpler implementation and not nearly as visually appealing.
